\section{Introduction}

The convergence of quantum computing and cloud infrastructure represents a paradigm shift in computational capabilities. While quantum computing offers exponential advantages for specific problem classes through quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, cloud computing provides scalable, accessible infrastructure for data processing and storage. This paper presents a practical implementation of quantum-cloud integration that combines these technologies to create a hybrid computing system.

Traditional cloud systems face limitations in handling computationally intensive tasks such as cryptographic operations, optimization problems, and complex simulations. Quantum computing addresses these limitations by leveraging quantum mechanical properties to solve specific problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, quantum systems require classical infrastructure for control, measurement, and data processing, making quantum-cloud integration essential for practical quantum computing applications.

Our implementation demonstrates a working quantum-cloud system using AWS Braket for quantum circuit execution, AWS S3 for cloud storage, and Docker for containerized deployment. The system successfully executes quantum algorithms and stores results in cloud infrastructure, providing a foundation for scalable quantum computing applications.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Quantum Circuit Implementation}

The core quantum functionality is implemented using AWS Braket, which provides access to quantum simulators and hardware. The primary quantum circuit implemented is a Bell state preparation:

\begin{figure}[h]

\setlength{\fboxsep}{8pt}
\textbf{Code 1: Bell State Circuit Implementation}
\vspace{3pt}
\hrule
\vspace{3pt}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\ttfamily\scriptsize, breaklines=true]
from braket.aws import AwsDevice, AwsSession
from braket.circuits import Circuit
import boto3

# Initialize AWS session
aws_session = AwsSession()

# Select quantum device (simulator)
device = AwsDevice("arn:aws:braket:::device/quantum-simulator/amazon/sv1")

# Create Bell state circuit
bell_circuit = Circuit().h(0).cnot(0, 1)

# Execute circuit with 100 measurements
task = device.run(bell_circuit, shots=100)
result = task.result()

# Display measurement results
print("Measurement Counts:", result.measurement_counts)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

This implementation creates a maximally entangled two-qubit state, demonstrating fundamental quantum phenomena within the cloud infrastructure.

\subsubsection{Cloud Storage Integration}

Results from quantum computations are automatically stored in AWS S3 for persistence and further analysis:

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.put_object(
    Bucket='quantum-results-bucket',
    Key='bell_state_results.txt',
    Body=str(result.measurement_counts)
)

def upload_to_s3(file_path, object_name):
    s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
    try:
        s3_client.upload_file(file_path, AWS_S3_BUCKET, 
                             object_name)
